# Initial Setup
1. **Connect Power Supply**: Plug the power supply into the Bitaxe 1366 and then connect it to a power source.
2. **Initial Wi-Fi Connection**: Upon powering up, the miner will attempt to connect to the default Wi-Fi, which will fail initially.
3. **Access Miner's Wi-Fi Network**:
    - On your computer or smartphone, locate the Wi-Fi network named 'BitX'.
    - Connect to this network.
    - A setup page should automatically open. (If using a smartphone and the page doesn't appear, try using a computer.)

## Configuring the Miner
1. **Access AXE OS System**: This is the direct interface for your Bitaxe 1366.
2. **Set Up Wi-Fi**:
    - Change the Wi-Fi SSID to match your network.
    - Ensure to connect to a 2G network, as 5G is not supported.
    - Enter your Wi-Fi password carefully, including any spaces or capital letters.
3. **Configure Mining Settings**:
    - Enter the Stratum URL, port, and user information for your chosen mining pool.
    - Options include solo mining or pool mining with pools like CK Pool or Grains Pool.
4. **Save and Restart**: After adjusting the settings, save and restart the miner.

## Post-Setup
1. **Wait for Reconnection**: The miner will reconnect to your regular Wi-Fi network.
2. **Find IP Address**: After a few minutes, check the miner for its IP address.
3. **Access Miner for Advanced Settings**: Use the IP address to access the miner from a computer for additional configurations like overclocking or underclocking.

## Performance and Efficiency
- The Bitaxe 1366 typically hashes over 450 GH/s, with possibilities to reach up to 600 GH/s with special adjustments.
- Power consumption is around 13 Watts, comparable to a light bulb.
- The efficiency is on par with the S19 XP model.
