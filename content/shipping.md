# Shipping Policy

## Introduction

All vendors in the shop are independant makers, we do not ship bitaxes ourselves this is a community "vetted" store. If you encounter any problems with your shipment please direct your questions to the seller.

## Shipping prices

All prices listed come with shipping cost included a vendor can choose to select zones they support shipping too, 

## Order process
Your shipping and order details are only shared with the vendor you bought from not with the community, however a fixed amount of the order goes to OSMU, this can go trough a proxy wallet with a read only credential making it possible to announce that a bitaxe has been bought trough the store. Also durring order you will only see products of the same vendor once you have selected a product.
